<h2>Sticky Element</h2>

<div class="sticky">Fishing and Beer. That is life.</div>

<p>Take a seat</p>
<h2>Go back up to 'remove' sticky position</h2><br>
<p>There is a lot to remember,

    however, with a lot of practice and hard work,<br><br><br><br><br>

    most people with the right attitude can accomplish big things.<br><br><br><br><br>

    Fly fishing in the mountains of Western North Carolina has been ideal.<br><br><br><br><br>

    There are tons of native trout, cold streams, and zero tourists.<br><br><br><br><br>

    Tourists coming to town have caused tons of traffic on the small roads.<br><br><br><br><br>

    There is a lack of infrastructure for the volume of cars on the road.<br><br><br><br><br>

    Another good thing about living in Asheville is all the beer.<br><br><br><br><br>

    There are a ton of craft breweries in Asheville<br><br><br><br><br>

    So many in fact, that I have not been able to try them all.<br><br><br><br><br>

    I certainly have my favorite breweries and there are some that have terrible beer.<br><br><br><br><br>

    The only drawback to having so many breweries is the lack of imported beer.<br><br><br><br><br>

    I am a huge fan of beer from Germany and Belgium.<br><br><br><br><br>

    All the breweries here try to emulate that style beer but none have gotten it right<br><br><br><br><br>

    I'm sure it has to do with the German Purity Law of 1516.<br><br><br><br><br>

    This law only allows German Breweries to brew with four ingredients in their beer.<br><br><br><br><br>

    Water, hops, barely, and yeast, which was later added.<br><br><br><br><br>

    America, let alone states, don't have a law where that is the requirement.<br><br><br><br><br>

    This brings about all the flavors in the beer, hence craft beer.<br><br><br><br><br>

    It is certainly not a bad thing.<br><br><br><br><br>
